Lesson Planner is a web-app designed to help teachers plan their lessons without having to worry about time. Once signed up you will have access to saving the lesson plans and use them later and verifying your email will unlock the full length responses. 

Authentication and the Database is done with Firebase. I also use their cloud functions to cleanse the database from unwanted information like unused anonymous accounts.
